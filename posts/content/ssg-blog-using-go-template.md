# New blog

I've rewritten my blog, for the 3rd time in 3 months. Why? Don't even ask.

## What

Well, currently I have a [Go](https://go.dev) static-site-generator, that takes in [JSON](https://json.org) and [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) data and spits out nice noscript-compatible static HTML files.

## Why

Honestly, because the previous code sucked. It was a pretty bad [React](https://reactjs.org/) codebase, and also, it ran horribly, was heavy, and others. Now, I have a nice, flexible codebase and system, which makes development, bugfixes, and others very easy.

## So

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/manen/website), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maneney_), have a nice day, goodbye. \
(Also please ignore the .html ending thank you)
